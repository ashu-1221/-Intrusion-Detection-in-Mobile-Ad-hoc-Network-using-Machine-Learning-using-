## Blackhole Intrusion Detection in Mobile-Ad-hoc Network using Machine Learning
## Introduction
MANETs (Mobile Ad hoc NETworks) are a very unique type of wireless communication as they are highly dynamic & unpredictable in nature. We can not easily identify the topology in a MANET due to the unavailability of central authority & the variable nature of nodes. Due to the ease of deployment and the rise in demand & popularity of mobile devices, these networks have recently become much more common and crucial to wireless communications. MANETs developed into a desirable technology for various applications. However, this flexibility introduces security threats. Additionally,these networks are not directly covered by the conventional
infrastructure-based approach. The adoption of an IntrusionDetection System (IDS) is quite crucial for MANET protection because preventative measures are never sufficient. In this paper,
we have used four different classification algorithms of machine learning(SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree) topredict whether the network is attacked by black hole or no

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of training and testing data files:
- `Train_data.csv`
- `Test_data.csv`





## Models
The project uses the following machine learning Classification algorithms for intrusion detection:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, training the models, and evaluating their performance.

## Results
The models are evaluated based on precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation metrics are visualized using bar plots for comparison.
